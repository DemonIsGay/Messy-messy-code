<h1>Vreative</h1>

<h2> Hello And Welcome to Vreative</h2>

<p1>I'm here today to review 4 sites that allowes you to be creative</p1>

<a href = "http://jacksonpollock.org/"> 
<h3>#1 jacksonpollock.org/</h3> </a>
<p2>Example</p2> <br>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/xGpdNY2.png" Width="500" Hight="500"> <br>

<p3>This site repreclates Jackson Pollock way of painting expect on the internet.</p3><br>
<p3>Move you're mouse around and the paint follows and if you let it sit in in one spot long enough it will make circuls bigger and bigger</p3><br>
<p3>And if you click it changes the paint color</p3><br>
<br>
<p4> now the pros and cons</p4><br>
<br>
<p5> the pros</p5> <br>
<p5> Its a cool site that lets you make art simalur to Jackson's</p5> <br>
<br>
<p6> the cons</p6><br>
<p6> while it is cool the site gets boring fast becuase there isnt much to do </p6><br>
<br>

<a href = "https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/">
    <h3>#2 quick draw with google</h3> </a>
</a>

<p2>Example</p2><br>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/HjR7Ben.png" Width="500" Hight="500"><br>
<p3>This site gives you 20 seconds to draw a prompt and have the AI try and guess what it is correctly</p3> <br>
<p3>It learns from other peoples drawings to accuretly guess what you're drawing</p3><br>
<br>
<p4>Now the Pros And Cons</p4><br>
<br>
<p5>the pros</p5><br>
<p5>Its a cool site to play with!! its cool that it learns from what other people drew for the prompt to guess what you drew</p5><br>
<br>
<p6>the cons</p6><br>
<p6>Same thing with the first site its cool at first but after awhile gets boring cool thing to mess around with from time to time</p6><br>

<br>
<p4>Now the pros and cons</p4><br>
<br>

<p3>This Site lets you paint with objects that follow your cursor yet go in random directions so you get cool patternts like the one in the example above</p3><br>
<br>
<p4>The pros and cons</p4><br>
<br>
<p5>The Pros</p5><br>
<p5>This site is really cool to mess around with and the objects that randomly move around the cursor as if its the sun is so cool</p5><br>
<br>
<p6>The Cons</p6><br>
<p6>You can't control the size and color its all randomize which often ruins the peace you where working on</p6><br>
